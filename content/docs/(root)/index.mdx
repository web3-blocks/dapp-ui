## What is dApp/ui?

**dApp/ui** is the Web3 UI toolkit for modern decentralized applications — built directly on top of the **shadcn/ui registry**.
You copy components into your project, meaning **you own the code** from day one. No locked-in APIs. No styling restrictions.

Designed for the realities of blockchain apps:

- **Multi-chain support** (Ethereum, Solana, Sui, Starknet & more)
- **Wallet-aware** components that just work
- **Built for production** — not demos or boilerplates
- **Radix + Tailwind** best-practice UX foundations

> Build decentralized UI the **shadcn way** — composable, customizable, and future-proof.
