description: Set up shadcn/ui and start adding Web3 components to your dApp.
---

To use **dApp/ui**, your project must first be configured with
[**shadcn/ui**](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation).
If you haven’t already set it up, start there.

---

## Configure the Registry

Add the **dApp/ui** namespace to your `components.json` file. This allows you to install components directly using the shadcn CLI.

```json title="components.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "registries": {
    "@dapp-ui": "https://dappui.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Running `@dapp-ui/connect` will automatically resolves to: `https://dappui.vercel.app/r/connect.json`

Learn more about registry config from [**shadcn/ui namespaces.**](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/namespace)

---

## Install Components

Now you can install Web3 components the same way you install any shadcn/ui component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @dapp-ui/connect
```

or install multiple components at once:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @dapp-ui/connect @dapp-ui/modal
```

> Note: Don't guess the component or block name, copy the cli command from on its category page. You now have **full control** of the component source — edit, extend, and style it however your dApp requires.
